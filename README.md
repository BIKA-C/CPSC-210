# Maze Game

by William Chen

## What Will the Application Do?

It is a maze solving game. The goal for the player is to find the exit. At the start of the game, the entire maze will be visible for short period of time, then the screen goes black and the maze becomes invisible. The character in the game will have a regional light source that illuminates a certain area within its current position. Player then will have control the character to explore the maze and find the way out. There might be random **traps**, and **special items** that help the player.

## Who Will Use It?

Everyone!
